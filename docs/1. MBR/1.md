# Getting started

This exercise is intended to;

1. Familiarise the student with basic tools for reconnaissance at a byte level in Windows
2. Demonstrate the meta-data associated with a sample MBR volume.

## Preparation
1. Do all this work in a VM
2. Obtain a disk sector editor such as WinHex.
3. Create a virtual disk in Windows as previously demonstrated in practical sessions. You may use __diskpart__ or the graphical disk tools. 
4. Document this disk's main parameters.
5. Initialize the disk as an MBR disk.
6. Create as many primary partitions as you can and create at least two extended partitions. 

I expect every student's partitions will be different!

## Demonstration
You may carry these exercises out both in Windows or in Linux, But to use a VM in every case.

### Windows
If you are using Windows, you can use the free tool WinHex or any other sector editor of your choice.

### Linux
In this example, I am doing a walkthrough using Linux and the commands __dd__ and __hexdump__. All the same principles apply whether you are using Linux or Windows. I created a virtual disk (sdb) to work with and mounted it to the VM.

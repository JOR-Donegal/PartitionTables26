# Introduction

!!! abstract "Partition Tables"

I could make you read all week on the topic of partition tables and their underlying metadata. You would sleep well but learn nothing!
By getting you to extract metadata structures, map and understand them, we can ensure a basic understanding. Before you start, you need to make sure you have understood my notes on [volume organisation]( https://jor-donegal.github.io/VolumeOrganisation26/). If you approach this methodically, it will all work fine.

You will be required to keep a list of commands with notes as to why you are using them as well as results of any testing you have done. You may be asked to present these notes as evidence of work completed or as part of a lab book. Check with your lecturer.

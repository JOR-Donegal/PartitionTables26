# Interpreting the Structure
In MBR

- From byte 0-445 are the boot loader and will probably be empty for a non-bootable partition.
- Each partition entry is 16 bytes long.
- Partition entry 1 will begin at offset 446 or 0x1BE
- Partition entry 2 will begin at offset 462 or 0x1CE  
- Partition entry 3 will begin at offset 478 or 0x1DE
- Partition entry 2 will begin at offset 494 or 0x1FE
- The end of the first sector is flagged by 0xAA55 at offset 510 and 511
- I had four partitions. By examining the MBR in detail, I can map these partitions, using an Excel sheet.

Partition 1 is a primary partition.

Partition 4 is a primary partition, type 05, extended.

Each byte is (obviously) 8 bits, but we store 16 or 32 bit words, each word is more than one byte. In what order do we store these bytes?

- We can store _most significant byte_ (MSB) first and _least significant byte_ (LSB) second, this is _big endian_. The number 0x12345678 is stored as 12 34 56 78 
- We can store LSB first and MSB second, this is _little endian_. The number 0x12345678 would be stored as 78 56 34 12 

The signature should be 0xAA55, so the dump is _little-endian_ (red).

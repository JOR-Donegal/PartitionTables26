# Getting started
GPT is an order of magnitude more complex, and I am not going to get you to do the same forensic drill down. However, I will bring you to the starting point, you could continue should you so desire.

## Preparation 

### Windows users
- Create a virtual disk in Windows as previously demonstrated in practical sessions. You may use diskpart or the graphical disk tools.
- Initialize the disk as an GPT disk.
- Create four primary partitions. 

### Linux Users
- Create an additional virtual hard drive on a Linux VM.
- This should show up as /dev/sdb

Using gdisk 
- Initialize the disk as an GPT disk.
- Create four primary partitions.  

## Build
In this example, I am doing a walkthrough using Windows and the free tool _WinHex_. All the same principles apply whether you are using Linux or Windows.

- Start off by documenting all disks which show in your system. If you pick the wrong disk later, you may render your system unusable!
- Created a VHD in Disk Manager, 1,000MB in size.
- For me, the disk was attached as soon as it was created. If not, attach the disk.
- Make sure you can identify which disk the VHD is before you continue; if in doubt, STOP!!

Open the new disk in WinHex (or any similar tool) and verify that the disk is blank; that all sectors are zero.

Right-click on the new disk and initialize.

Document the disk number (10 in my case) and select GPT.
